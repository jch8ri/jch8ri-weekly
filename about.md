Hello, this is a page created for my class in open source software. I am a junior at Hunter College and I am taking this class
with Professor Stewart Weiss in spring 2019. Any assignments and contributions that I make to the open source world through 
class assignments or personal projects will be posted here and will be discussed in my weekly [blog posts].(https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/jch8ri-weekly/) 
### More Information

A place to include any other types of information that you'd like to include about yourself.
