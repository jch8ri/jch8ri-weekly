This is my first blog post for the open source software class with Professor Weiss. As of now, 
I do not have any valuable information to input in the post but will definitely update these 
posts with more information as the semester goes along. This is just a test run for now. Thankyou!


The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. 
Go into /_posts/ and update the 2019-02-01-week01.md file.
